# Green Slime

Green slimes are yellow-green oozes that are highly poisonous. They often 
hunt by waiting in ambush, poisoning something that comes close enough, 
and then slowly slithering behind it while the poison does its work.

**Squelch:** A green slime can make a melee attack with a pseudopod. This 
attack deals 1d6+Str damage.

**Poison goo:** When a green slime attacks, it can use a stunt for 4 SP
that causes the target to become poisoned. A poisoned creature must make
a Constitution check against a difficulty of 11 at the start of each turn. 
If it fails, it takes 2 damage that ignores armor. If it succeeds, then it 
is no longer poisoned.
