**Slimy Mess:** When a blue slime attacks, it can use a stunt for 2 SP that leaves behind a slimy mess.
The target of the attack takes a -1 penalty to Dexterity until it spends a minor action to remove the slime.

## Green Slime

Green slimes are yellow-green oozes that are highly poisonous.
They often hunt by waiting in ambush, poisoning something that comes close enough, and then slowly slithering behind it while the poison does its work.

**Poison goo:** When a green slime attacks, it can use a stunt for 4 SP that causes the target to become poisoned.
A poisoned creature must make a Constitution check against a difficulty of 11 at the start of each turn. 
If it fails, it takes 2 damage that ignores armor.
If it succeeds, then it is no longer poisoned.
